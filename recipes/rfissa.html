    <!--Steps to make Rfissa-->
    <h3>Steps to Make it:</h3>
    <ol>
        <h3>Ahead of Time</h3>
        <li>To reduce their pungency and soften them, soak the<br>
            fenugreek seeds in water for at least several hours or<br>
            overnight if possible. When ready to use, drain. Although they<br>
            are normally stewed directly in the broth, you may want to<br>
            tie the soaked lentils in cheesecloth, which allows you to<br>
            offer them on the side in the event someone at the table<br>
            doesn't care for them.</li>
        <li>If you'll be cooking a regular chicken, you may also want to<br>
            soak your lentils for a few hours, as it will help them to cook<br>
            faster.</li>
        <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, mix the chicken with the<br>
            onions, olive oil, salt, pepper, ginger, turmeric, and ras el<br>
            hanout spices. Stir to coat the chicken well, cover, and set<br>
            aside to marinate for a few hours or overnight in the<br>
            refrigerator.</li>
        <li>Make and shred the msemen or trid pastry into bite-size<br>
            pieces – note that it's easiest to shred the msemen while<br>
            they're hot—OR plan to make the msemen while the chicken<br>
            and lentils are simmering on the stove.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
        <h3>Cook the Chicken and Lentils</h3>
        <li>Place the chicken on the stove over medium heat and cook,<br>
            covered, stirring occasionally, for about 15 to 20 minutes,<br>
            until a rich sauce has formed.</li>
        <li>Follow one of these methods, depending on the type of<br>
            chicken you're cooking:<br><br>

            <strong>If using a free-range chicken</strong>, add the drained fenugreek<br>
            seeds, saffron, parsley, cilantro and 4 to 5 cups of water.<br>
            Cover and simmer over medium-low to medium heat for<br>
            about one hour. Add the lentils and continue cooking,<br>
            covered, for another hour or longer, until the chicken and<br>
            lentils are quite tender. Add water during the cooking if<br>
            necessary to ensure that rich, ample broth is left in the pot.<br><br>

            <strong>If using a regular, factory-raised chicken</strong>, add the drained<br>
            lentils, drained fenugreek seeds, saffron, parsley, cilantro and<br>
            3 to 4 cups of water. Cover and simmer over medium-low to<br>
            medium heat for about one hour, or until the lentils are<br>
            tender and the chicken is well-cooked. (Remove the chicken<br>
            if the lentils do not yet test done; it can be returned to the<br>
            pot to reheat once the lentils have finished cooking.) There<br>
            should be ample, rich broth in the pot; if there's not, add a<br>
            little water, taking care not to dilute the seasoning.</li>
        <li>Taste the broth and adjust seasoning. Add the teaspoon of<br>
            smen, swirling the pot to mix it into the broth.</li>
        <li>If desired, remove the chicken from the pot and place it<br>
            under a broiler for a few minutes to brown and crisp the skin.</li>
    </ol>
    <!--Serve the Chicken Rfissa-->
    <ol>
        <h3>Serve the Chicken Rfissa</h3>
        <li>Shortly before serving time, heat a little water in the base of<br>
            a couscoussier. Place the shredded msemen in the steamer<br>
            basket over the water, and steam for about 10 minutes, until<br>
            tender and heated through.</li>
        <li>Arrange the msemen on a large serving dish. Add the chicken<br>
            to the bed of msemen, and distribute most of the broth,<br>
            onions, and lentils over the chicken and msemen. Reserve a<br>
            bowlful or two of broth to offer on the side. </li>
        <li>If you tied the fenugreek in cheesecloth, you can also offer<br>
            the fenugreek in a bowl on the side.</li>   
        <li>Moroccan tradition is to gather around this single large dish,<br>
            with each person eating from his own side of the plate by<br>
            hand or with a spoon.</li>
