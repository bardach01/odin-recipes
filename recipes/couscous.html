         <!--Instructions for preparing The Meat-->
    <ol>
        <h3>Make the Meat:</h1>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Mix the meat, onion, tomatoes, oil, and spices in the bottom of a couscoussier.<br>
            Cook uncovered over medium to medium-high heat,<br>
            stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes, or until the meat is browned and<br>
            the onions and tomatoes have formed a thick sauce.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add the water, the parsley/cilantro bouquet, and the chickpeas, if using. Cover,<br>
            and bring to a boil over high heat.<br>
            Reduce the heat to medium, and simmer rapidly for 25 to 30 minutes.<br>
            (If omitting both meat and chickpeas, simmer for just a few minutes.)</li>

    <!--The first instructions for steaming The Couscous-->
    <ol>
        <h3>First Steaming of Couscous:</h1>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <br>
        <li>While the meat is cooking, get the couscous ready for its first steaming.<br>
            Oil the steamer basket and set it aside.<br>
            Empty the dry couscous into a very large bowl, and work in the vegetable<br>
            oil with your hands, tossing the couscous and rubbing it between your palms.<br>
            (This will help prevent the couscous grains from clumping together.)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Work in 1 cup of water in the same manner, using your hands to evenly<br>
            distribute the liquid into the couscous.<br>
            Transfer the couscous to the oiled steamer basket.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add the cabbage to the meat mixture, and place the steamer basket<br>
            on top (seal the joint if necessary).<br>
            Once you see steam rising from the couscous, steam the couscous for 15 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Pour the couscous back into the large bowl and break it apart.</li>
        <br>
        <li>When the couscous has cooled enough to handle, gradually work in 2 cups of water<br>
            and 1 tablespoon of salt with your hands.<br>
            Again, toss the couscous and rub it between your palms to break up any balls or clumps.<br>
            Transfer the couscous back into the steamer,<br>
            taking care not to pack or compress the couscous.</li>
        <h3 style="color: darkgray;">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>
    </ol>    
    <!--The secound instructions for steaming The Couscous-->
    <ol>
        <h3>Second Steaming of Couscous:</h1>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add the turnips, carrots, tomatoes, onions, and fava beans (if using) to the pot.<br>
            Place the steamer basket on top of the couscoussier (seal the joint if necessary),<br>
            and steam the couscous a second time for 15 minutes,<br>
            timing from when you see the steam rising from the couscous.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Once the couscous has steamed for 15 to 20 minutes, turn it out into the large bowl again.<br>
            Break it apart, and let cool a few minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>If you're serving the couscous with jalapeño peppers, simmer the peppers,<br>
            covered, in a half-ladle of broth and a little water, for about 40 minutes,<br>
            or until the jalapeños are tender. (The peppers are typically placed on top of the couscous,<br>
            and small pieces may be broken off as a condiment.)</li>
        <h3 style="color: darkgray;">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>
    </ol>   
      <!--The third instructions for steaming The Couscous-->
      <ol>
        <h3>Third Steaming of Couscous:</h1>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Gradually work 3 cups of water into the couscous with your hands,<br>
            tossing it and rubbing the grains between your palms.<br>
            Taste the couscous, and add a little salt if desired.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Transfer about half of the couscous to the steamer basket. Again,<br>
            try to handle the couscous lightly and avoid packing it into the steamer.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add the squash, zucchini, and sweet potatoes, if using, to the couscoussier,<br>
            and place the steamer basket on top. (Again, seal the joint if necessary.)</li>
        <br>
        <li>When you see the steam rise through the couscous, carefully add the remaining couscous to the steamer.<br>
            Continue cooking, watching for the steam to rise from the couscous. Allow the couscous to steam for a full 15 to 20 minutes.<br>
            At this point, all of the vegetables should be cooked. Test the vegetables to be sure, cooking longer if necessary.<br>
            Taste the broth—it should be salty and peppery—and adjust the seasoning if desired.</li>

        <h3>Serving the Couscous and Vegetables:</h1>
        <li>Empty the couscous into the large bowl, and break it apart.
            Mix in the 2 tablespoons of butter with 2 ladles of

               <u><strong>broth</strong></u></a>.</li>
        <br>
        <li>To serve the couscous, shape it into a mound with a well in the center. Put the meat into the well,<br>
            and arrange the vegetables on top and all around.<br>
            Distribute the broth evenly over the couscous and vegetables, reserving one or two bowlfuls to<br>
            offer on the side for those who prefer more.</li>

    <!--a Tip-->
    <div>
        <h3>Tip:</h3>
        <h4>If you see steam escaping from between the basket and couscoussier, you'll need to seal the joint.<br>
            You can do this in several ways: wrap and tie a long piece of a damp cloth over the joint,<br>
            tightly wrap a long piece of kitchen plastic film around the joint,<br>
            or wrap and drape a long piece of kitchen plastic film onto the rim of the couscoussier,<br>
            and then place the basket on top.</h4>
